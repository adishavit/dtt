# DTT Heuristics Registry

All heuristics that assume intent or suppress diagnostics based on convention
rather than proof. Each must be explicitly approved before implementation.

## 1. Out-Parameter Initialization

**Location:** `src/DTTPlugin.cpp` — `VisitCallExpr`, after argument invalidation loop

**What:** When `&local_var` is passed to a non-const `T*` parameter, mark the local
variable as initialized after the call.

**Tradeoff:**
- *Eliminates:* False positives on the standard C/C++ out-parameter idiom
  (`decode(input, &code, &extra_bits)`)
- *May mask:* True uninitialized reads if the callee doesn't actually write through
  the pointer (rare for this calling convention)

**Scope:** Local variables only (`hasLocalStorage`), scalars and structs.

**Approved:** Sprint 2, 2026-02-22

## 2. Signed Array Index Non-Negativity

**Location:** `src/DTTPlugin.cpp` — array bounds check Z3 fallback path

**What:** When Z3 cannot prove `idx >= 0 && idx < size` (a counterexample exists or
the solver gives up) but proves `idx < size` (upper bound only), suppress the
diagnostic. The assumption: signed integers used as array indices are
non-negative by convention. An index the known facts force out of bounds (for
example `if (x < 0) return a[x];`) is still reported.

**Tradeoff:**
- *Eliminates:* False positives on `if (x < N) return arr[x]` where `x` is a signed
  parameter or function return value (distance tables, strlen results)
- *May mask:* True negative-index bugs where a signed variable happens to have a
  valid upper bound but is actually negative

**Scope:** Signed integer indices only. Unsigned indices and indices without any
upper-bound proof are unaffected.

**Approved:** Sprint 3, 2026-02-23
